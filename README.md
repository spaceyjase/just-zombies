## GGggaarrrghlllh!

A lo-fi, short (tiny!) survival horror based on the arena shooting genre. Can you survive 60 seconds in a zombie apocalypse?

### How to play

WASD to move. HJKL to fire. Shoot zombies, survive an apocalypse!

If you're using a gamepad, left-stick moves while controller buttons (typically XYAB) shoot. Same rules!
